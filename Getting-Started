So you want to make websites using HTML? Here is a quick guide to help you set up.

First, you need to create a repository, use whatever name you like, as this does not affect your website.
You will then want to use create a new file. Name it whatever but with rules:

-No spaces can be used, if you want to use these replace them with a dash ( - )
-It must include .html at the end, otherwise it will not register as a page (Example of a name: main.html )
-You can't name it using fonts or text, otherwise you won't be able to type it into the searchbar when you want to view your website

Once you have named your file you need to type in <!DOCTYPE HTML> (This formats the file you creatd to display on your github page.)
After that, you need to press enter then type in <html>
Press enter again then type in <body>

Once you have done that your code should look like this:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>

Now, you need to add some kind of text to your site so when you look at it so when you look at your website it isn't blank.
There are a few types of text:

-Headings
-Plain text
-Text masked links

When it comes to text, it's not the same as formatting, in this page we're just going into headings.

To add a heading to your website, you need to type in <h>
After that, type anything in (spaces are acceptable with text) then type in </h>

When it comes to text and embeds and other forms of html, you start with something like <h>
Then close it with </h>
The letter may very with whatever task is being carried out, but closing brackets always have a slash ( / ) before the letter.

Your header's code should look like this:

<h>The Name Of Your Website</h> (Once more, choose the text that goes there!)

When you are ready to view your site, save the file, then create a github page, settings > pages
Make sure the branch is main, you can select the name of your website.  Once you create it you can visit your page.
